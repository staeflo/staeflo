#👨🏻‍💻 Hi, I'm Flo

**`Theoretical Physicist` **


Hello! I'm a theoretical physicist who loves exploring the realms of finance, data science, and physics through coding. My projects span financial models, data analyses, and simulations that help me learn and understand complex concepts. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I'm always eager to enhance my skills and discover new insights, enjoying the process of learning and creating along the way. Whether it's understanding the universe or analyzing market trends, I find joy in the journey of coding and learning.
